# MCU Mixed Message

Welcome everybody to my first project!

This is my first site using HTML, CSS and Javascript (beginner level). The main idea of this site is to select a random character from the MCU. Then, depending on the result it will show a random quote from this character, a film and a picture. 

### Things to do

* Select a random film
* Change the background image depending on the character
* Implement new ideas
* Add media query
